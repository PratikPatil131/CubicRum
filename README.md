Game Development for Stress Reduction

# CHAPTER 1

#
# **INTRODUCTION**

This chapter focuses on introduction of Simulation necessity, objectives of the proposed system, theme and report organization

## 1Introduction

  1.
#### Introduction

The proposed system is computer application that allows various users to play this game. This project is specially developed for people in work sector, students and also for other people. These days more peoples are having mental health issues like stress, social problems etc. Most victims of stress are found in job sector, where there are factors like workload, job security. Here primary goal is to make a game that will lower the stress of person.

In this project we include several levels of different difficulties. Here, user can play all levels serially. After one level gets completed, user can start the next level. Each level contains more complexity than the previous. For each level score board display the score. Best score is recorded for that level.

  1.
#### Necessity

The main necessity of this project is to reduce stress of working people as well as students and many other people also. Using this system user can play different levels of this game which will help to reduce stress.

#### 1.3 Objective

The main purpose of the project is focus, entertainment and reducing the stress of people.The main purpose of the project is to reducethe stress of people. Now days every person working in various sector get stressed due to work load. Using this project these people can play the game for a while and it can reduce the stress at some extent. The major advantage is this game can be played anywhere and anytime.

#### 1.4 Domain

The project work is based on Game Development. We are building this game with platform independency.

#### 1.4.1 Game Development

The birth of video games has slowly shifted the meaning of traditional games into a digitalized

Multimedia games. The term of games refer to the meaning of video games. Nowadays, games can be played in almost any device, and that is why developing games can be a profitable industry. To support the growth of gaming industry, several original equipment manufacturer (OEM) publicly distribute their software development kit (SDK) and application programming interface (API) to attract people to become &quot;indie developer&quot;.

Game is a kind of software with goal to provide entertainment. However, during the real game development practice, simply adopting the software development life cycle (SDLC) is not enough, as the developers face several challenges during its life cycle. To address the problem, game development uses a kind of specific approach called game development life cycle (GDLC) to direct the game development.

#### 1.4.2 Technology used

1.4.2.1 Unity

**Unity**  is a cross-platform real-time engine developed by Unity Technologies,first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.&#39;s Worldwide Developers Conference as an OS X-exclusive game engine. As of 2018, the engine has been extended to support 27 platforms.The engine can be used to create both three-dimensional and two-dimensional games as well as simulations for its many platforms. Several major versions of Unity have been released since its launch, with the latest stable version being Unity 2018.3.9.

Unity gives users the ability to create games and interactive experiences in both 2D and 3D, and the engine offers a primary scripting API in C#, for both the Unity editor in the form of plug-in, and games themselves, as well as drag and drop functionality. Prior to C# being the primary programming language used for the engine, it previously supported Boo, which was removed in the Unity 5 release, and a version of JavaScript called _Unity Script_, which was deprecated in August 2017 after the release of Unity 2017.1 in favour of C#.

1.4.2.2 Visual Studio

**Microsoft Visual Studio**  is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silver light. It can produce both native code and managed code.

Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense as well as code refactoring. The integrated debugger works both as a source-level debugger and a machine-level debugger. Other built-in tools include a code profiler, forms designer for building GUI applications, web designer, class designer, and database schema designer. Visual Studio supports 36 different programming languages and allows the code editor and debugger to support (to varying degrees) nearly any programming language, provided a language-specific service exists.

# CHAPTER 2

# **PROBLEM ANALYSIS AND SOLUTIONS**

This chapter describes the problem statement in detail and possible solutions.

1.
## Problem Analysis and Solutions

## 2.1 Problem Analysis

According to American Institute for Stress at the most basic level, stress is our body&#39;s response to pressures from a situation or life event. What contributes to stress can vary hugely from person to person and differs according to our social and economic circumstances, the environment we live in and our genetic makeup. Some common features of things that can make us feel stress include experiencing something new or unexpected, something that threatens your feeling of self, or feeling you have little control over a situation.

When we encounter stress, our body is stimulated to produce stress hormones that trigger a &#39;flight or fight&#39; response and activate our immune system. This response helps us to respond quickly to dangerous situations.

2.1.1Problem Statement

These days more peoples are having mental health issues like stress, social problems etc. Most victims of stress are found in job sector, where there are factors like workload, job security. Our primary goal is to make a game that will lower the stress of person. We are also focused about how our product will increase brain usage and concentration power.

## 2.2 Solutions to the problem

## 2.2.1 Solution No.1:

**Meditation** : Meditation and mindful prayer help the mind and body to relax and focus. Mindfulness can help people see new perspectives, develop self-compassion and forgiveness.

**Get social support:**  Call a friend, send an email. When you share your concerns or feelings with another person, it does help relieve stress. But it&#39;s important that the person whom you talk to is someone whom you trust and whom you feel can understand and validate you.

**Smile and laugh:**  Our brains are interconnected with our emotions and facial expressions. When people are stressed, they often hold a lot of the stress in their face. So laughs or smiles can help relieve some of that tension and improve the situation.

**Exercise**** :** The research keeps growing - exercise benefits your mind just as well as your body. We keep hearing about the long-term benefits of a regular exercise routine. But even a 20-minute walk, run, swim or dance session in the midst of a stressful time can give an immediate effect that can last for several hours.

2.2.2 Solution No.2:

From recent studies it is proved that playing games even violent games reduces stress. One study examined players as they played either competitive or cooperative games. As predicted, there was a difference in stress levels after playing, and those who played cooperatively experienced a greater decrease in stress levels, but the difference was slightâ€”both groups experienced decreases in stress by playing the game. In addition, both groups retained positive feelings toward the other players, though there was a slightly higher regard for those who were cooperative. This is another way in which video games can provide positive social experiences and a decrease in stress.

Our project is based on this solution.
